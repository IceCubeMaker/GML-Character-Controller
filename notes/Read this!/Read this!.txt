Charcon is an addon, made to make controlling the player character easy.
It include the input 5 library from juju adams. 
And some other useful scripts I have created myself
The input 5 documentation is here:
https://www.jujuadams.com/Input/#/6.0/

Right now Charcon only includes top down 2D movement.
But future versions might include more types of player movement.

How to use

in the object that you want to use as your player avatar, 
put "charcon_attach()" and you're good to go;

it works right out of the gate with controller thanks to input 5;
on PC the controls are WASD or arrow keys + space bar for dashing

You will also find a folder called floors. You can use these as parent objects. 
If the player is on top of a floor it changes the behaviour

in the scripts folder you will find all charcon specific scripts
